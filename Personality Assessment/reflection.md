# Reflection: Personality Assessment 

## **Situation**
As part of the career development portfolio, I was required to complete a personality assessment to better understand my strengths, preferences, and possible career alignments.

## **Task**
My task was to complete the assessment honestly and thoughtfully, then reflect on the results in relation to my personal and professional development.

## **Action**
I completed the assessment and carefully reviewed the results. I identified key traits in my personality and I compared these traits with different work environments and roles to see what types of careers might suit me best. I also considered how these traits affect the way I work with others and solve problems.

## **Result**
The personality assessment helped me better understand myself and how I interact with others. It gave me clarity on the types of roles where I would thrive and feel fulfilled. This reflection will help guide my future career choices and personal growth, especially in choosing a work environment that matches my personality.
