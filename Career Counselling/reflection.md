# Career Counselling Reflection

## Reflection using the STAR Method

**S – Situation**  
As part of my digital portfolio, I completed a self-guided career counselling activity. This resource was designed to help me think about my career goals, strengths, and areas of interest.

**T – Task**  
My task was to go through the material, reflect on the type of career that suits me, and consider what steps I can take to move in that direction.

**A – Action**  
I followed the activity instructions carefully and answered all the questions honestly. I spent time thinking about my values, strengths, and what kind of work environment I might enjoy. I also explored potential careers that align with my personality and interests.

**R – Result**  
The activity helped me gain clarity about what I want in a future career. I now feel more focused and motivated to explore jobs that fit my skills and preferences. It also showed me areas I might need to improve or learn more about.
