# Reflection: Create CV 

**Situation:**  
As part of a career preparation module, I completed an activity that focused on the key components of creating a CV. The activity tested my understanding of what to include in a professional CV.

**Task:**  
I had to read information about CV writing and then answer questions to demonstrate my knowledge of CV structure, what to include, and how to present myself effectively to potential employers.

**Action:**  
I carefully read through the learning materials and answered each question based on what I understood about writing an effective CV. I paid close attention to tips on formatting, language, and choosing the right content to include.

**Result:**  
The activity helped reinforce my understanding of how to build a strong CV. I now feel more confident about writing and reviewing my own CV. It also highlighted a few areas I need to work on, such as tailoring my CV to specific job roles and using stronger action verbs to describe my skills and experiences.
